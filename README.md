# Data Structure Algorithms
Most Common data structures algorithms - Implemented in Java

the goal of this project is to teach DS to my students

1. Binary Search: A search algorithm that works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, and eliminating the half that cannot contain the target value. This algorithm is typically used to search for a target value in a sorted array.

2. QuickSort: A sorting algorithm that works by partitioning an array into two sub-arrays, and then recursively sorting the sub-arrays. This algorithm has an average time complexity of O(n log n), and is often used in practice due to its efficiency and simplicity.

3. MergeSort: A sorting algorithm that works by recursively dividing an array into two halves, sorting each half, and then merging the two sorted halves. This algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of O(n log n), and is often used when stability is important, as it preserves the relative order of equal elements.

4. Depth-First Search (DFS): A graph traversal algorithm that works by exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. This algorithm is typically used to traverse trees and graphs.

5. Breadth-First Search (BFS): A graph traversal algorithm that works by exploring all the neighboring nodes at the present depth before moving on to the nodes at the next depth. This algorithm is typically used to traverse trees and graphs.

6. Dijkstra's Algorithm: A shortest-path algorithm that works by iteratively selecting the vertex with the smallest distance, and then relaxing all adjacent edges. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(|V|^2) or O(|E| log |V|) depending on the implementation, and is typically used to find the shortest path in a weighted graph.

7. Bellman-Ford Algorithm: A shortest-path algorithm that works by iteratively relaxing all edges in the graph. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(|V||E|), and can handle graphs with negative-weight edges.

8. Trie: A tree-based data structure used for efficient string searching and storage. This data structure is typically used for autocomplete and spell-checking applications.

9. Bloom Filter: A probabilistic data structure used for testing whether an element is a member of a set. This data structure is typically used for efficient membership testing in large sets.

These are just a few examples of the many data structure algorithms that are used in computer science. There are many other algorithms that are used for specific purposes and in specific contexts.
